# Task Backlog

Inbox for new tasks. A human adds an entry; the AI turns it into a task file. See
`README.md` for how. The rules come from the `task` plugin, not from this
directory.

Entry format — `### [<kind>: ]<short title> [<status>, <priority>]` plus a short
explanation. Once the AI has created the task file, it adds a `file: <link>` line
under the heading and keeps the brackets up to date as the status changes. An entry
is removed when its task is cleaned, so this file shows open work only.

Kinds are `feature:`, `bug:` and `task:`, written before the title, and they decide
what the branch is called and nothing else. No prefix means `task`.

Statuses:

* `draft` — written down, not planned yet.
* `planning` — a human asked the AI to plan it.
* `planned` — cleared to implement: a plan written and waiting for a human to
  verify it, or set by a human **with no plan** in the task file, which waives it.
* `in_progress` — the AI is implementing it on its branch.
* `in_review` — implementation ready on the branch, waiting for review.
* `changes_requested` — review asked for changes.
* `approved` — review passed, ready to merge.
* `done` — merged and branch deleted.

Priorities: `high` | `medium` | `low`.

## Backlog


### powerpoint presentation [draft, low]

- when tasks workflow and plugin/skill implementation, a powerpoint presentation would be nice


### reduce readme and skills [done, low]

file: [reduce-readme-and-skills.md](reduce-readme-and-skills.md)

- has skill files or readme grown during edits? Is it possible to reduce text? Can the text be less verbose?
